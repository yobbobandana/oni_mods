Automatically calculates several useful quantities for every geyser. These values are added to the geyser's information panel.

Calculated values:
[list]
  [*] average flow rates (active period only and full lifetime average)
  [*] required buffer mass to maintain average flow rates
  [*] thermal cooling capacity for geysers under 20°C
  [*] thermal energy output for geysers above 95°C
  [*] number of steam turbines potentially powered by heat output (in tooltip)
  [*] for steam geysers specifically, how many turbines they can directly feed (in tooltip)
[/list]

I got tired of calculating these values by hand every time i wanted them, so i made a script to do it.

Then i got tired of running that script every time i wanted these values, so i put it into the game.

Now here it is! It's pretty straightforward, just adds the info to the details panel that appears when you click on a geyser. Some info will be hidden until the geyser is analyzed, so this doesn't give you any info you couldn't have worked out yourself.

All values have explanatory tooltips, which i tried to make as clear as possible.

Temperatures will of course be in your desired units: C, F or K.

Steam turbine calculations are provided as part of the tooltip when hovering over the thermal information. They assume a desire for maximum power, and assume the turbine is externally cooled (or an aquatuner is used). If you prefer self-cooled setups, simply multiply the expected number of turbines by 3. I considered adding more info for steam turbine setups, but it got overcomplicated very quickly so i went with the basics here.

As always, any feedback is welcome.
