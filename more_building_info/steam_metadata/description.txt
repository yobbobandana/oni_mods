Adds a small amount of very useful information when constructing and selecting buildings.

Selected buildings will now tell you their input requirements, not only their output/effects.

When constructing, any room-relevant building traits are now listed among the effects. This includes traits such as "Industrial Machinery", "Flush Toilet", "Recreational Building", "Decor Item", and so on.

There's not much more to it. I'm not really sure why this information is not consistently displayed in game. It's all available in one view or another. If i have to mod such sensibility in, then so be it.

The full list of traits that will be shown:
[list]
 [*] Industrial Machinery
 [*] Toilet
 [*] Flush Toilet
 [*] Wash Station
 [*] Plumbed Wash Station
 [*] Medical Equipment
 [*] Decor Item
 [*] Recreational Building
