Adds a small amount of very useful information when constructing and selecting buildings. Room traits (such as "Recreational Building" or "Industrial Machinery") are added to both views, and input requirements are now included in selection information alongside output and effects.

There's not much more to it. I'm not really sure why this information is not consistently displayed in game. It's all available in one view but not another.

These are the traits that will be shown:
[list]
 [*] Industrial Machinery
 [*] Toilet
 [*] Flush Toilet
 [*] Wash Station
 [*] Plumbed Wash Station
 [*] Medical Equipment
 [*] Decor Item
 [*] Recreational Building
[/list]

The input requirement information added to the selection information panel is the same as that shown when constructing the building.
