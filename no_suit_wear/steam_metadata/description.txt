Removes suit wear. Suits will always remain at 100% durability. They will no longer wear out and break.

This is effectively the same as setting Durability to "Indestructible" in the custom game settings when starting a new game. But maybe when you were starting the game you forgot? Or you just didn't know? You can't change that setting now... but you [i]can[/i] add this mod.

The mod can safely be added and removed with no other consequence. The setting will go back to whatever it was after uninstall. It just locks durability to 100% while enabled.

Acknowledgements: Thanks to Sonia_k for discussion and image wrangling, and a special shout out to Astrologic for going 2000 cycles before noticing suit wear was a thing ;)
