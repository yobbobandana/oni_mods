A full new cluster with Rust-based starting planet, and several unique features.

Two starts are provided, one with a medium rusty planetoid comparable in size to an ordinary Spaced Out style start. The other start is small-sized but otherwise similar, comparable in size to the teleporter and crashed satellite worlds.

This is a somewhat difficult starting scenario, best for experienced players or those seeking a challenge.

Both clusters are found in the "Spaced Out" menu (not "Classic").

[h2]Key features[/h2]
[list]
 [*] A new starting planetoid, consisting mostly of rust.
 [*] An optional mini-sized start, for an even more Spaced Out feel. Also good for that old weak laptop you really shouldn't be playing ONI on.
 [*] Overhauled teleporter and rocket planetoids specifically for this cluster.
 [*] New tiny asteroids: sandstone, wasteland, and swampy marsh.
 [*] New geysers: liquid ethanol and liquid chlorine, both guaranteed in the starting world.
 [*] An expanded starmap: 15 rings in stead of 11.

[h2]Details[/h2]

I started this to test the possibility of a single-biome starting planet, and was pleasantly surprised with the result. Try it out and let me know what you think!

The starting world and the initial teleporter and rocket expansions have all been completely rewritten. The biggest change is that biome density is reduced, with the starting world having only one primary biome, and no planetoid having more than two. This encourages the player to utilize the resouces available, in this case a stupid amount of ethanol and rust, and also to fly, explore, and ship resources between planetoids.

Combined with a greatly increased starmap size (feedback needed), it gives a much more "spaced out" Spaced Out than anything yet shipped with the DLC.

Even though these worlds have reduced size, the reduced biome density makes them feel larger with fewer barriers to expansion. Try the medium-sized one if you like building a large primary base, and try the mini-sized one for a spread-out cluster of bases.

[h2]Known issues[/h2]
[list]
 [*] The asteroid images on the starmap and in the main menu are not quite correct. Any help is welcome here.
 [*] It still needs playtesting. Feedback is welcome.
